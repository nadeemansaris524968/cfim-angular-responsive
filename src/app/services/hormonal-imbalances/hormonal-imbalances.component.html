    <h2>Hormonal Imbalances Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What are hormonal imbalances?</p>
    <p>Hormones act as your body’s chemical messengers, telling your tissues and organs what they need to do to adapt to
      your ever-changing environment. Hormones also control major processes like reproduction and metabolism. </p>
    <p>A hormone imbalance occurs when you have either too little or too much of a specific hormone — and even a small
      discrepancy can have a big impact.</p>
    <p class="question">What are the symptoms of a hormonal imbalance?</p>
    <p>Because hormones are so vital to your overall well-being, imbalances come with a variety of side effects. These
      may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Muscle weakness</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Unexplained or sudden weight loss or weight gain</li>
      <li>Excessive sweating</li>
      <li>Muscle stiffness, aches, or tenderness</li>
      <li>Increased hunger or thirst</li>
      <li>Unusual sensitivity to heat or cold</li>
      <li>Constipation or an unusual frequency of bowel movements</li>
      <li>Depression</li>
      <li>Decreased sex drive</li>
      <li>Infertility</li>
      <li>Irritability, anxiety, or nervousness</li>
      <li>Puffy or rounded face</li>
      <li>Thinning or fine and brittle hair</li>
      <li>Dry skin</li>
      <li>Pink or purple stretch marks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you have several of these symptoms, it’s important to speak to your provider. Dr. Ansari can let you know if
      these signs indicate a hormone imbalance or are due to an unrelated issue. Either way, you can be confident in
      receiving the highest standard of care.</p>
    <p class="question">What causes hormonal imbalances?</p>
    <p>While everyone is different, you may experience a hormonal imbalance due to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stress</li>
      <li>Mold toxins</li>
      <li>Injury or trauma</li>
      <li>Environmental pollutants</li>
      <li>Eating disorders</li>
      <li>Specific medications</li>
      <li>Chronic Lyme disease and infections</li>
      <li>Benign or cancerous tumors</li>
      <li>Chemotherapy or other cancer treatments</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certain chronic health conditions, such as diabetes, Cushing syndrome, or thyroiditis, can also contribute to
      hormonal imbalances.</p>
    <p class="question">How will my hormonal imbalance be treated?</p>
    <p>First, Dr. Ansari performs a physical exam and reviews any medications, supplements, or vitamins you may be
      taking. He may request a blood sample for testing.</p>
    <p>If your hormone levels are lower than ideal, you may need hormone replacement therapy. This may take the form of
      an injection or oral medication. </p>
    <p>While some physicians prioritize either male or female hormone imbalances, Dr. Ansari is qualified to address a
      wide range of needs regardless of sex, including concerns with thyroid hormones, adrenal fatigue, or other
      conditions that impact your vitality and performance. </p>
    <p>You don’t have to go through life feeling like each day is a challenge. To address hormonal imbalances and
      restore your zest for living, book an appointment online today.</p>
