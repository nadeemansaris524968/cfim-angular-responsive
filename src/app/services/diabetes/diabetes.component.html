    <h2>Diabetes Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What exactly is diabetes?</p>
    <p>Diabetes is a chronic disease. It impacts how your body processes glucose, which is a type of sugar that serves
      as a primary source of energy.</p>
    <p>When you have diabetes, your body either doesn't produce enough insulin (which is a hormone that regulates blood
      sugar) or cannot effectively use the insulin it makes. The result is elevated blood sugar levels. If not
      controlled, it can lead to severe complications.</p>
    <p class="question">What are the different types of diabetes?</p>
    <p class="underline">Type 1 diabetes</p>
    <p>This type of diabetes occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in
      the pancreas. Individuals with type 1 diabetes require insulin therapy to help manage their blood sugar levels
      effectively.</p>
    <p class="underline">Type 2 diabetes</p>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance. Meaning that the body's cells do not respond properly to
      insulin, leading to elevated blood sugar levels over time. Type 2 diabetes is often associated with lifestyle
      factors, such as obesity, poor diet, and lack of physical activity.</p>
    <p class="question">How is diabetes treated?</p>
    <p>Dr. Ansari typically treats diabetes with a multi-pronged approach, including:</p>
    <p class="underline">Lifestyle modifications</p>
    <p>Making healthy lifestyle choices is essential in managing diabetes. California Functional Internal Medicine
      Clinic provides personalized guidance on nutrition, physical activity, and stress management to help you maintain
      optimal blood sugar levels. Supplements</p>
    <p>Dr.Ansari uses his Functional Medicine experience to use various supplements which can help your body get more
      sensitized to insulin and control your blood sugar levels more naturally if possible.</p>
    <p class="underline">Medication Management</p>
    <p>Depending on the type and severity of diabetes, medication may be necessary to help control blood sugar levels.
      Dr. Ansari works closely with you to develop a tailored medication regimen that effectively manages your diabetes
      while minimizing side effects.</p>
