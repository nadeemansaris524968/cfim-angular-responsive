    <h2>Hypertension Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What should I know about hypertension?</p>
    <p>Hypertension, or high blood pressure, is a chronic health condition caused by the pressure of blood against the
      walls of your blood vessels. You can learn a great deal from how your blood pressure changes when you are
      exercising, relaxing, or stressed.</p>
    <p>Stress causes your blood pressure to increase, which may impact your initial readings when your primary care
      provider is checking you over. </p>
    <p>One of the benefits of having a physician you are comfortable with is more accurate testing. Dr. Ansari can
      diagnose you with hypertension if you have above-average blood pressure readings on at least two different visits
      to his office.</p>

    <p class="question">How does hypertension impact my heart health?</p>
    <p>Hypertension increases your risk of having a stroke or a heart attack. If your blood puts too much pressure
      against your blood vessel walls, they stiffen and thicken, becoming less flexible. As a result, your heart must
      work harder to circulate your blood.</p>
    <p>If your heart muscle must work harder, this leads to health problems like congestive heart failure (CHF) and
      coronary artery disease (CAD).</p>
