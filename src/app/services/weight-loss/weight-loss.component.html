    <h2>Weight Loss Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What is considered a healthy weight range?</p>
    <p>Maintaining a healthy weight range is essential for your overall well-being and reducing the risk of various
      health conditions. Typically, a healthy weight range is determined using your body mass index (BMI), which
      considers your weight in relation to your height. </p>
    <p>For most adults, a BMI ranging from 18.5 to 24.9 is typically regarded as indicative of good health. However, BMI
      may not always be the most accurate measure, as it doesn't account for factors like muscle mass or distribution of
      fat.</p>
    <p class="question">When should weight loss be considered?</p>
    <p>Weight loss should be considered when your weight exceeds the healthy range, leading to health issues or
      increasing the risk of developing conditions, such as: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Heart disease</li>
      <li>Liver disease</li>
      <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
      <li>High blood pressure</li>
      <li>High cholesterol</li>
      <li>Sleep apnea</li>
      <li>Joint problems</li>
    </ul>
    <p>At California Functional Internal Medicine Clinic, Dr. Ansari may recommend weight loss if you
      have
      obesity-related complications or have a BMI over 30.</p>
    <p class="question">How does weight loss work?</p>
    <p>California Functional Internal Medicine Clinic offers a functional medicine approach for weight loss, focusing on
      addressing the underlying factors that might contribute to your weight gain and health issues. Your personalized
      weight loss plan may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nutritional counseling</li>
      <li>Identifying food sensitivities</li>
      <li>Addressing hormonal imbalances</li>
      <li>Optimizing gut health</li>
      <li>Managing stress</li>
      <li>Promoting lifestyle changes, such as regular physical activity and adequate sleep</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Dr. Ansari assesses your dietary habits, nutritional deficiencies, and metabolic imbalances to develop a tailored
      eating plan that supports weight loss and overall health. This may involve emphasizing whole, nutrient-dense
      foods, balancing macronutrients, and incorporating supplements as needed.</p>
    <p>Medication may be prescribed in certain cases to support your weight loss efforts, particularly if your lifestyle
      changes alone are insufficient. However, medication should always be used in conjunction with dietary and
      lifestyle modifications under Dr. Ansari’s guidance to ensure safety and effectiveness.</p>
    <p>Other functional medicine treatments may include herbal medicine, and stress management techniques to complement
      weight loss strategies. These holistic measures promote sustainable and long-term success in helping you achieve a
      healthy weight.</p>
