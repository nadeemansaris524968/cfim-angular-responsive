    <h2>Mold Toxicity Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What is mold toxicity? Is Black Mold Toxic?</p>
    <p>Mold toxicity refers to the adverse health effects that occur when you’re exposed to high levels of mold or mold
      spores in your environment. Mold toxicity can result from inhaling or ingesting mold particles or toxins produced
      by certain types of molds. Black mold is one of the toxic types of mold which can make people sick.</p>
    <p class="question">What are the symptoms of mold toxicity?</p>
    <p>Symptoms of mold toxicity can vary widely and may resemble those of other health conditions, making it
      challenging to diagnose.</p>
    <p>Common symptoms include issues, such as:</p>
    <ul>

      <li>Sinusitis</li>

    <p class="question">What causes mold?</p>
    <p>Mold thrives in damp and humid environments, making areas like bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and poorly
      ventilated spaces susceptible to mold growth.</p>
    <p>Leaky roofs, plumbing issues, flooding, and inadequate ventilation contribute to mold growth indoors. Certain
      types of building materials, such as drywall, insulation, and carpeting, can also be a breeding ground for mold
      when exposed to moisture.</p>
