    <h2>Heavy Metal Toxicity Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What is heavy metal toxicity?</p>
    <p>Heavy metal toxicity refers to the accumulation of heavy metals in your body beyond normal levels, leading to
      adverse health effects. </p>
    <p>Heavy metals are naturally occurring elements found in the environment, but industrial activities, pollution, and
      certain occupations can increase exposure levels. Common heavy metals associated with toxicity include lead,
      mercury, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium. </p>
    <p class="question">What are the symptoms of heavy metal toxicity?</p>
    <p>Symptoms of heavy metal toxicity can vary depending on the specific metal involved, the level of exposure, and
      factors, such as your age and overall health. However, common symptoms may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Gastrointestinal issues</li>
      <li>Neurological symptoms</li>
      <li>Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)</li>
      <li>Skin abnormalities</li>
      <li>Kidney dysfunction</li>
      <li>Musculoskeletal issues</li>
      <li>Behavioral changes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>During your appointment with Dr. Ansari, heâ€™ll learn about your symptoms, perform a comprehensive evaluation, and
      determine an accurate diagnosis and treatment.</p>
    <p class="question">What causes heavy metal toxicity?</p>
    <p>Several factors contribute to heavy metal toxicity, including:</p>
    <p class="underline">Environmental exposure</p>
    <p>Pollution from industrial activities, mining, and agricultural practices can contaminate air, water, and soil
      with heavy metals, leading to human exposure through consumption, inhalation, or skin contact.</p>
    <p class="underline">Occupational exposure</p>
    <p>Certain occupations, such as mining, smelting, manufacturing, and construction, involve working with heavy metals
      or in environments where exposure is likely, increasing the risk of toxicity. </p>
    <p class="underline">Food and water contamination</p>
    <p>Heavy metals can enter the food chain through contaminated water sources, soil, or food processing methods.</p>
    <p class="question">How is heavy metal toxicity treated?</p>
    <p>California Functional Internal Medicine Clinic treats heavy metal toxicity with a functional medicine approach.
      Dr. Ansari addresses the root cause and supports your body's natural detoxification processes. Treatment
      strategies may include: </p>
    <p class="underline">Nutritional interventions</p>
    <p>Providing your body with nutrients, such as antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, can support detoxification
      pathways and help eliminate heavy metals. </p>
    <p class="underline">Chelation therapy</p>
    <p>Oral Chelation therapy is a treatment that uses ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and or other natural
      chelators to bind with heavy metals in your blody and facilitate their excretion through your urine or feces.</p>
    <p class="underline">Lifestyle modifications</p>
    <p>Dr. Ansari recommends avoiding further exposure to heavy metals by consuming organic foods, filtering water, and
      reducing your exposure to environmental pollutants.</p>
    <p class="underline">Supportive therapies</p>
    <p>Utilizing techniques like sauna therapy, lymphatic drainage, and acupuncture can enhance detoxification and
      support your overall health. </p>
    <p class="underline">Individualized treatment plans</p>
    <p>You can rely on Dr. Ansari to tailor your treatment based on your specific heavy metal exposure, health status,
      and biochemical individuality.</p>
