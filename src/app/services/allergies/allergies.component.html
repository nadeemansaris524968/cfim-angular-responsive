    <h2>Allergies Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What are allergies?</p>
    <p>Allergies are immune system responses triggered by substances that are usually harmless to most people. If you
      have allergies and come into contact with substances, known as allergens, your immune system perceives them as
      threats and overreacts, leading to various symptoms.</p>
    <p>These symptoms can range from mild to severe and may even cause potentially life-threatening reactions, such as
      anaphylaxis. </p>
    <p class="question">What are common allergens?</p>
    <p>Common allergens involve a wide range of substances, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pollen</li>
      <li>Dust mites</li>
      <li>Pet dander</li>
      <li>Mold spores</li>
      <li>Insect stings</li>
      <li>Certain foods</li>
      <li>Medications</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Allergens can even come from certain chemicals, such as those found in pesticides and food additives. Food
      intolerances, while not true allergies, can also lead to adverse reactions and are often mistaken for allergies.
    </p>
    <p>These intolerances typically involve difficulty digesting certain foods and can cause symptoms like bloating,
      diarrhea, or stomach cramps. </p>
    <p class="question">How are allergies diagnosed?</p>
    <p>Diagnosing allergies usually involves a combination of learning your medical history, giving you a physical
      examination, and performing specialized tests. Skin prick tests and blood tests, such as the specific IgE test,
      are commonly used to identify allergens. </p>
    <p>In skin prick tests, small amounts of allergens are introduced into your skin to observe your body's reaction.
      Blood tests measure your levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which increase in response to allergen
      exposure. </p>
    <p class="question">How are allergies treated?</p>
