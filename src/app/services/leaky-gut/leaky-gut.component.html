    <h2>Leaky Gut Q & A</h2>
    <p class="question">What is a leaky gut?</p>
    <p>Leaky gut syndrome refers to a condition where the lining of your small intestine becomes damaged, allowing
      undigested food particles, toxins, and other harmful substances to leak into your bloodstream. This leakage
      triggers an immune response, leading to inflammation and potentially causing a range of health issues.</p>
    <p class="question">What are the symptoms of a leaky gut?</p>
    <p>Symptoms of a leaky gut can vary widely and may include the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bloating</li>
      <li>Gas</li>
      <li>Diarrhea</li>
      <li>Food sensitivities or allergies</li>
      <li>Skin issues, such as eczema or acne</li>
      <li>Fatigue</li>
      <li>Brain fog</li>
      <li>Insomnia</li>
      <li>Headaches</li>
      <li>Joint pain</li>
      <li>Mood disorders, such as anxiety or depression</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you experience any of these symptoms, book an appointment at California Functional Internal Medicine Clinic
      for an accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.</p>
    <p class="question">What causes a leaky gut?</p>
    <p>Some of the factors that can contribute to the development of a leaky gut include:</p>
    <p class="underline">Diet</p>
    <p>Consuming a diet high in processed foods, refined sugars, and unhealthy fats can disrupt the balance of your gut
      bacteria and damage your intestinal lining.</p>
    <p class="underline">Chronic stress</p>
    <p>Stress can impair your digestive system’s function and weaken your intestinal barrier.</p>
    <p class="underline">Excessive alcohol consumption</p>
    <p>Alcohol can irritate your intestinal lining and contribute to inflammation.</p>
    <p class="underline">Medications</p>
    <p>Certain medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics, can disrupt your gut
      microbiome and increase intestinal permeability.</p>
    <p class="underline">Environmental Toxins</p>
    <p>Exposure to environmental toxins like Mold toxins, pesticides, heavy metals, and pollutants can damage your
      intestinal lining.</p>
    <p class="question">How is a leaky gut treated?</p>
    <p>At California Functional Internal Medicine Clinic, Dr. Ansari treats leaky gut with a holistic approach that may
      include:</p>
    <p class="underline">Dietary modifications</p>
    <p>Eliminating inflammatory foods like gluten, dairy, and processed foods while emphasizing whole, nutrient-dense
      foods can help heal your gut lining and reduce inflammation.</p>
    <p class="underline">Gut-healing supplements</p>
    <p>Certain supplements like probiotics, prebiotics, L-glutamine, and digestive enzymes may support your gut health
      and repair your intestinal barrier.</p>
    <p class="underline">Stress Management</p>
    <p>Techniques like mindfulness, meditation, and relaxation exercises can help reduce your stress levels and support
      your digestive function.</p>
    <p class="underline">Lifestyle Changes</p>
    <p>Getting regular exercise, prioritizing sleep, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can all
      promote your gut health.</p>
    <p class="underline">Identifying and treating underlying conditions</p>
    <p>Dr. Ansari can identify and address underlying conditions, such as Mold toxicity, gut dysbiosis, SIBO (small
      intestinal bacterial overgrowth), or candida overgrowth, which can contribute to leaky gut.</p>
